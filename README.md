# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
- Turning data into easily consumable visual insights, using Tableau.
- Creating impactful dashboards that help stakeholders make decisions, based on a business questions.
- Communicating insights with the correct visualizations.

## Process
1. Download the dataset from the Kaggle website: [Cause of Death - Our World In Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ivanchvez/causes-of-death-our-world-in-data?resource=download).

2. Upload the dataset to Tableau.

3. Create five questions and try to find answers

4. Create Dashboards

5. Create story/presentation

## Results
### I decided to choose option 2.
### Dataset : Causes of Death - Our World In Data
The Global Burden of Disease is a major global study on the causes of death and disease published in the medical journal The Lancet. This dataset shows the causes of the edaths from year 1990 to 2019.

## Download and Clean the data
1. I download the raw file from the Kaggle website: [Cause of Death - Our World In Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ivanchvez/causes-of-death-our-world-in-data?resource=download).

2. Dataset is already cleaned. So, I checked it and loaded the raw file in tableau for exploratory data distribution and applying some pivoting and cleaning.

## Questions

### 1. Used Set Actions and Perameters. 
Show top x causes of death and total deaths by perticular cause for y year. (x = number of causes, y = range of years)

![Question 1](https://github.com/AkashKadia47/Data-Visualization-and-Dashboards-with-Tableau/blob/main/Image/Question%201.png)<br>

- conclusion
    - The bar chart on right shows top 10 causes of death. 
    - The bar chart on left shows the number of deaths from Cardivascular diseases.
    - It seems the number is growing during each years.

### 2. Use Tooltips.
Show the percentage of Causes of Death by Year(Hover over causes bar to get the percentage)

![Question 2](https://github.com/AkashKadia47/Data-Visualization-and-Dashboards-with-Tableau/blob/main/Image/Question%202.png)<br>

- conclusion
    - The image shows total edaths causes by Cardivascular Diseases are 33.76%

### 3.  Use Forcast Model.
Show the prediction of top  x causes of death. (x = number of causes of death)

![Question 3](https://github.com/AkashKadia47/Data-Visualization-and-Dashboards-with-Tableau/blob/main/Image/Question%203.png)<br>

- Conclusion
    - The line chart shows cardivascular diseases are growing rapidly
    - Neonatal disorders are getting under control


### 4. Create animation 
Show Death by Cardivascular Diseases during all the years to get information about top 3 countries.

![Question 4](https://github.com/AkashKadia47/Data-Visualization-and-Dashboards-with-Tableau/blob/main/Image/Question%204.png)<br>

- Conclusion
    - THe graph shows China, America and India are the countries where the death rate because of Cardivascular diseases are the highest.

### 5. Create Dual Axis Pie Chart.
Show top 3 countries and top x causes of death. (x = number of causes of death)

![Question 5](https://github.com/AkashKadia47/Data-Visualization-and-Dashboards-with-Tableau/blob/main/Image/Question%205.png)<br>


## Challenges 
This project was straight forward, there were not much cleaning just try to comeup with the questions and use different graphs to answer those questions.

So, I decided to use different advance tableau techniques to answer each questions.

## Future Goals
The time was sufficient but still I would try to create graphical dashboards and use links, buttons as well.s
